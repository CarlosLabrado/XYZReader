# XYZReader

The purpose of this app is to get an _ugly_ app and redesign it with the android **Material design** mindset.

This is for the fifth project of the nanodegree.

## Install

Just open it in your Android studio
This was made with the **Android Studio 2.0 Beta 6** so it needs this gradle tool to work:
```
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0-beta6'
}
```
